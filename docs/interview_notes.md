## Key Talking Points

1. **RBAC Modeling**
   - Demonstrates the ability to design business roles, technical roles, and entitlement mappings.
   - Shows understanding of least privilege and structured access design.

2. **Lifecycle Workflows (JML)**
   - Illustrates how Joiner / Mover / Leaver processes maintain consistent, secure access.
   - Shows alignment with framework requirements for timely provisioning and deprovisioning.

3. **Audit and Certification**
   - Provides templates and evidence that support audit readiness.
   - Shows accountability, reviewer sign-off, and traceability.

4. **Governance Perspective**
   - Highlights understanding of security controls, separation of duties, and compliance alignment.
   - Shows ability to think beyond tooling and focus on system-wide governance.

## Identity-First, Framework-Led Governance (Interview Talking Point)

**“My approach is framework-first. The framework defines the control requirements—least privilege, SoD, auditability. Identity governance implements those controls through RBAC, JML workflows, and certifications. Then cloud security enforces the decisions with roles, policies, conditional access, and logging. Finally, audit validates that the entire lifecycle is correct. This end-to-end chain is how I structure identity-first security programs.”**

## How to Describe the Project

**“This lab demonstrates how I design and document identity governance processes, including RBAC modeling, lifecycle workflows, access certification templates, and audit evidence. All artifacts are fictional but structured to reflect real governance practices used across industries.”**
