# Identity Governance & Administration (IGA) Lab
This project demonstrates core Identity Governance & Administration (IGA) concepts using fictional but realistic data.
It models the foundational elements of enterprise access governance, including:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Entitlement bundling
- Joiner / Mover / Leaver lifecycle workflows
- Access certification processes
- Segregation of Duties (SoD) controls
- Audit evidence and compliance alignment

All examples are intentionally vendor-neutral and platform-agnostic.
No real systems, employers, or proprietary configurations are referenced.

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate governance thinking, identity lifecycle logic, and risk-based access control design — skills that apply across all modern IGA platforms.
