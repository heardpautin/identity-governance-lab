# Identity Governance & Administration (IGA) Lab

This project demonstrates core Identity Governance & Administration (IGA) concepts using fictional but realistic data.  
It reflects how organizations design and maintain access controls using role modeling, lifecycle workflows, certifications, and audit practices.

All examples are fully vendor-neutral and platform-agnostic.  
No real systems, employers, or proprietary processes are referenced.

The goal of this lab is to illustrate practical identity governance thinking, including:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Entitlement mapping and access design
- Joiner / Mover / Leaver lifecycle handling
- Access certification and attestation
- Separation of Duties (SoD) considerations
- Audit documentation and evidence readiness
