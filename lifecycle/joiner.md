# Joiner Workflow

This workflow outlines how access is granted when a new individual joins the organization.

1. The HR system creates the new identity record with initial attributes.
2. A role-based access package is determined using job function or department.
3. The manager reviews and approves the initial access set.
4. Governance checks are performed, including role alignment and SoD considerations.
5. Provisioning tasks are executed (automated or manual).
6. The new user receives confirmation of account readiness.
7. All activity is logged for audit and compliance tracking.
