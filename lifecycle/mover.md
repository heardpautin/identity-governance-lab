# Mover Workflow

This workflow describes how access is updated when an individual changes roles, departments, or responsibilities.

1. The HR system updates the user’s job role, department, or other key attributes.
2. A review of current access is triggered to identify entitlements that may no longer be required.
3. New required access is identified based on updated role or function.
4. Access removal and access assignment tasks are scheduled or executed.
5. The manager confirms that the updated access set aligns with job duties.
6. Any exceptions or special cases are documented for audit tracking.
7. All changes are logged to maintain a clear audit trail.
