# Leaver Workflow

This workflow describes how access is removed when an individual leaves the organization.

1. The HR system marks the user as inactive, separated, or terminated.
2. The user account is immediately disabled to prevent further access.
3. All entitlements are removed, including application access and shared resources.
4. Remote access, VPN connectivity, and authentication tokens are revoked.
5. System owners or managers are notified of the deprovisioning event.
6. A record of the access removal is retained for compliance and audit requirements.
7. All actions are logged to ensure complete traceability.
